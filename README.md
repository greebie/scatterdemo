## How to get this working

`cd /path/to/scatterdemo`
`source .venv/bin/activate`

(this will set you up with a Python 3 virtual environment that includes my dependencies.)

Then you can ensure that you have jupyter notebook installed.

`pip3 jupyter-notebook`

If you encounter other errors, a `pip3 {library-name}` may help, but as new things come up
I will add them to this list.
